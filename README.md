# ✈️ The Perfect Reunion - Hackathon Project

Find the perfect travel destination for your group of friends, anonymously and playfully.

Inspired by *Cards Against Humanity*, players create anonymous **travel cards** with images, interests, budget, and preferences. Then, everyone plays by guessing or interacting with others’ cards — and gets matched to the perfect destination using Skyscanner data.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

1. **Create Your Travel Card**  
   Upload images, choose hashtags, set budget, preferred dates/climate, and eco-friendly preferences.

2. **Play the Game**  
   Guess whose card is whose, or vote on trips you'd join. All cards are anonymous.

3. **Reveal Results**  
   See where each person is going and which group is most aligned!
